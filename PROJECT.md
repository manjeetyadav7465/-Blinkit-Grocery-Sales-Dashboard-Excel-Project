# -Blinkit-Grocery-Sales-Dashboard-Excel-Project
I created this interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel to analyze grocery sales performance across outlet size, outlet location, item type, fat content, and outlet establishment year.

🔍 Key insights covered:
• Total & average sales analysis
• Item-wise and outlet-wise performance
• Rating trends and customer behavior
• Impact of outlet size and location on sales

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, pivot tables, slicers, charts, and dashboard storytelling.

I’m actively learning Data Analytics and would love to connect with data analysts, Excel professionals, and recruiters.
